## UTF8 Column Names

As many machine learning models do not work properly with arbitrary UTF8 names, `mlr3` defaults to throwing an error if any of the column names passed to `r ref("as_task_regr()")` (and other task constructors) contain a non-ASCII character or do not comply with R's variable naming scheme.
Therefore, we recommend converting names with `r ref("make.names()")` if possible.
You can bypass this check by setting `options(mlr3.allow_utf8_names = TRUE)` (but do not be surprised if errors occur later, especially when passing objects to other packages).
